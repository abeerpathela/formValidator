# 📝 **Form Validator**

A beautifully designed and fully functional **Form Validation Project** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project validates user inputs in real time and displays alert messages for incorrect or missing fields.

---

## 🌟 **Overview**

This project ensures that the form collects valid data by checking:

* ✔️ All fields are filled
* ✔️ Contact number must be exactly 10 digits
* ✔️ Password must contain at least **one number** or **one special character**
* ✔️ Password and Confirm Password must match

All validation feedback is shown using interactive alert pop-ups.

## 🚀 **Project Screenshots**

Screenshots were not inside the repository, so GitHub could not display them.

### 📌 How to Fix Screenshot Display

1. Create a folder named `screenshots` inside your project.
2. Upload all PNG screenshot files there.
3. Replace this section with:

```md
### Screenshot 1
![Screenshot 1](screenshots/s1.png)

### Screenshot 2
![Screenshot 2](screenshots/s2.png)

### Screenshot 3
![Screenshot 3](screenshots/s3.png)

...add more as needed
```

## Once you upload the screenshots, I can automatically generate this section for you.

## 🧠 **Validation Logic**

The form uses JavaScript to validate all fields. Features:

* Checks if any input is empty
* Ensures contact number is exactly 10 digits
* Password must include at least 1 number or 1 special character
* Confirms both passwords match
* Alerts user with custom pop-ups
